### Project Description
AN EDUCATIONAL WEBSITE, THAT PROVIDES AWARENESS TO CHILDREN ABOUT THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS AND PERSONAL SPACE.

### The Problem statement
TRADITIONAL CHILD SAFETY EDUCATION FAILS BECAUSE OF BORING DELIVERY,LONG TEXT,WITHOUT VISUAL INTERACTIVITY WHICH OVERWHELMS THE KIDS.

EACH SUPER HERO HAS THEIR OWN UNIQUE SUPER POWER:
1.CAPATAIN CONSENT:THE RIGHT TO SAY"NO"
2.DETECTIVE DAYA:THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD.
3.JUSTICE JAYA:THE RIGHT TO PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW.

FINALLY THEY ARE PROVIDED WITH SOME SITUATION BASED QUIZ.

**System Architecture:**
![alt text](image-7.png)
*unlike apps that need constatnt internet this  site works like an one time download game
once it loads everything runs locally .
a kid could open the website via a whatsapp link , to load all html pages ,quizes and superheros. the website sows interactive stories via these heros. content organization such as simplified pocso act,hero illustrations and backgroung images*


**Application Workflow:**
![alt text](image-8.png)
*website discovery,loading the site, choosing a hero,story experience with favourite super heros,the quiz testing knowledge,reward and completion. when quiz button clicked javascript detects click. functioncall occurs, then the necessary resources fetched and returned*
